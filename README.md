# GHG Emission Model

## Overview
The GHG Emission Model is a web-based application designed to visualize greenhouse gas emissions based on various parameters such as geographical location, population, area, and other city-specific characteristics. The application provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with a global map, select cities, and view their estimated GHG emissions.

## Features
- Interactive world map displaying cities and their associated GHG emission levels.
- Clickable cities that display detailed information including:
  - City name
  - Population
  - Area
  - Key attractions
  - Estimated GHG emissions
- Utilizes a machine learning model to predict emissions based on city parameters.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:**
  - HTML/CSS
  - JavaScript
- **Backend:**
  - Python
  - Flask for web framework
  - Pickle for loading the trained machine learning model
